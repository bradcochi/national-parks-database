i implemented the mongo db
current blocker is auth

6/27
got auth to create account but get_hashed_password does not work

6/28
no blockers, helped get the duplicate account error working, will work on two new issues this afternoon
Just added the back-end call to the API that grabs parks data by state

6/29
we had a blocker on setting visited and reviewed as bools that defaulted to false. Riley helped us. We just had to add bool = False and then reset existing entries in database. Then I implemented a PUT request that changed the visited key from false to true!
