we had a blocker on setting visited and reviewed as bools that defaulted to false. Riley helped us. We just had to add bool = False and then reset existing entries in database. Then I implemented a PUT request that changed the visited key from false to true!

so many blockers this am! Worked out the map system bugs that brad implemented so that they worked locally on our machines- had to do with a --force command during set up. also worked through a blocker where i had to redownload my project. Assisted with getting the park details page up, sign up, login page, as well as added link from homepage to details page for each park.

7/13
started out getting the visited page up and running and then hit a blocker on how to get the delete button to work using redux. Will be following tutorials this afternoon until I get it figured out.
