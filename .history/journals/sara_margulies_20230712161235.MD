Just added the back-end call to the API that grabs parks data by state

we had a blocker on setting visited and reviewed as bools that defaulted to false. Riley helped us. We just had to add bool = False and then reset existing entries in database. Then I implemented a PUT request that changed the visited key from false to true!
