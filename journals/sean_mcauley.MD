7/10

split coding/driving duties with Sarah and Brad on both the home page and the parks list by state pages for the front end. we had some blockers on setting up the state list on the home page but debugged as a group ang got both pages functioning by EOD.

7/11

did not drive or code today, but the team worked together on writing then refactoring front-end authorization to use REDUX.

7/12

the team spent the first part of the day implementing the react-usa-map to the home page. I added the link to the park details page from the parks list page and eventually began working on the park details page for front-end.

7/13

was not feeling well today and did not write any code for the project.

7/14

we reviewed the lectures on unit testing and began working together to write them. we eventually split up and I wrote the unit test for getting the list of parks by state, but ran into a bug which I was not able to figure out before EOD.

7/17

my teammates helped me figure out where the issue was, and a function did not match naming conventions across  the queries/routers files to the unit test, which was the cause of the bug from friday. we got that corrected and started merging the work some of us had done seperately until main was up to date and the same for all of us.
