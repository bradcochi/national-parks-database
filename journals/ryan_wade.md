We worked collaborately to set up the Docker-compose.yaml file and were able to get our project up and running. We are using a FARM stack for this project, meaning FastApi, React, and MongoDB. Also, began working on the login and authorization.

We are using an authentication library called "jwtdown-fastapi". All of the sign in, login, logout, token and authentication functionalities were completed today. The endpoints are working correctly in FastAPI. We worked as a team and wrote all features. I wrote the first issue related to logging in.
