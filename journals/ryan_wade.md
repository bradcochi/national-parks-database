We worked collaborately to set up the Docker-compose.yaml file and were able to get our project up and running. We are using a FARM stack for this project, meaning FastApi, React, and MongoDB. Also, we began working on the login and authorization.

We are using an authentication library called "jwtdown-fastapi". All of the sign in, login, logout, token and authentication functionalities were completed today. The endpoints are working correctly in FastAPI. We worked as a team and wrote all features. I wrote the first issue related to logging in.

We have made solid progress already on our backend endpoints. Sara got the GET function working for all parks from our third party API, which is the NPS API. NPS stands for National Park Service. This was a big step. I added the endpoint to get an idividual park and secured our API by moving it to
an env file and adding to the docker compose yml file.

Excellent progress thus far as all 19 of our backend endpoints are set up and working correctly in FastAPI. We rotated "drivers" meaning one person did the coding for some endpoints and the others watched and we talked through each step. Each individual has also set up some of the models. We had a minor blocker with the final end deleting a review. It was possible to delete a newly created view, but not if a view had been updated. This was resolved after some adjustments to the related queries file.
